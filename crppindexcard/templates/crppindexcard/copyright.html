We require this information to understand your city and to provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:

The City Resilience Profiling Programme (CRPP) has the objective to generate urban resilience profiles, indicators and standards to measure urban resilience.

The information you provide about your city is under the scope of the MoU signed between the city and UN-Habitat and CRPP.

CRPP will use the information about your city to generate your city urban resilience profile and indicators. This information might be published in restricted domains always under your consideration.
